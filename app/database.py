This PR contains the implementation of `[GET] /api/v1/organization/{org_id}/users` [PROTECTED Endpoint]

## Description

Added functionality for retrieving all users in an organization. This includes creating an endpoint `/api/v1/organization/{org_id}/users` that fetches all users in an organization from the database. The endpoint returns a list of users, each containing details such as first_name, last_name, username, email, etc.

## Related Issue (Link to issue ticket)
This is an implementation of an open issue #332 

## Motivation and Context

This feature  is required to provide an endpoint for users who are members of an organization to view all other users in the organization.

## How Has This Been Tested?

The new functionality has been tested using pytest, FastAPI test client, Postman and manual testing. Tests include:
- Retrieving all users in an organization the user belongs to
- Test cases for authentication and authorization
- Test cases for error scenarios (invalid UUID, organization not found, etc.)

Test environment:
- PostgreSQL database for storing blog information.
- Mock database setup using pytest for isolated testing.
- Test client setup using FastAPI for API endpoint testing.

## Screenshots (if appropriate - Postman, etc):
